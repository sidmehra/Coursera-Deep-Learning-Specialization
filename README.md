# Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization (offered by deeplearning.ai)

## Brief Overview of this specialization 

The Deep Learning Specialization is a 5-courses exhaustive online course created to unlock the potential of Deep Learning in building real-world applications that exhibit human-like characteristics. More information about this specialization can be found [here] (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).  The specialization is beautifully brought out by the leading online learning platform, Coursera. It is being offered by the company [deeplearning.ai] (https://www.deeplearning.ai/) , taught by none other than [Andrew Ng] (https://www.andrewng.org/) who is considered as one of the most promising figures in the area of Artificial Intelligence. 

In these five courses, we learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. We learn about Convolutional Networks, RNNâ€™s, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. We work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. The focus is not only on the theory, but how it is applied in industry. All these ideas are covered in Python and in TensorFlow.
